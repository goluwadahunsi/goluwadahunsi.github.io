      <h2 id="deg">DIPLOMA/DEGREE</h2> 
      <p>To become a tech bro via the conventional way is to  attend 
        a college or university to study either a diploma or bachelors
        in either Computer science/Engineering or Software Engineering. 
        This is a good route, however if you don't have tutors or lecturers with 
        industrial based approaches to tech, it will just become any other 
        academic degree and you might have to substitute with extra courses 
        elsehwere.

    <section class="boo" >
     <h2 id="camp">BOOTCAMPING</h2>
     <P>The second route is through the attendance of bootcamps which 
    is like a compacted 12weeks to 30weeks accelerated course on software 
    development and data science, they are usually tailored to meet your 
    end points either to become a cyber security expert, data scientist, 
    full-stack software developer etc. Bootcamps are good places, however you 
    must do your home work in other to be able to find the best and 
    affordable ones out there.

    <section class="self">
      <h2 id="crusader">SELF-TAUGHT</h2>
      <P>The last but not the least is the "self-taught" route 
      where you simulate your own learning modules and stick with it. This is 
      the hardest and most tricky road as you might end up focusing on outdated 
      concepts and algorithms, you can go to reddit or quora for a guide on how to start your
      journey if you really want to go via this route. I will however love to say 
      this route does not make you a less tech bro than the other two routes.
